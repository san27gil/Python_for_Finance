# How it works ðŸ¤” ðŸ¤“
It gives you some performance of the market to have a clear image of the current situation: 
1. The current stock market.
2. The performance of this year so far. 
3. Number of stocks up and down within the NASDAQ-100. 
4. Number of stocks below or above the 30 week moving average (to be implemented).
